    "***Context:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are widespread in all aspects of user-facing industries, from Netflix, to Amazon, to LinkedIn or to YouTube. Due to the large volumes of content, products or posts being generated daily, users would be overwhelmed with information and simple searches may not generate adequate results that may be relevant to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, recommender systems are a subclass of information filtering systems that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. For example, over 70% of watch time on YouTube is spent watching videos the underlying recommender algorithm recommends. In this project, a recommender system will be designed for Amazon shoppers that would recommend books they would most likely enjoy based on the reviews of others.\n",

    "\n",
    "***Problem Statement:***\n",
    "\n",
    "_How can we accurately recommend new books to users using a user-item approach to encourage expanding user preferences to books they may not have otherwise found on their own?_\n"

    "\n",
    "This project will be taking the collaborative filtering approach. It is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. To get recommendations, it looks at the items they like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions.\n",

This approach offers several advantages including scalability, accuracy and recommendations that are much easier to exaplin to users."
